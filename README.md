Wikipedia Scraper for Game Development Guide Microservice
-----------------------------------------------------

### How to REQUEST Data
Users can request data from this microservice by simply typing in a keyword into the interfaceâ€™s search engine. It would then match up with the closest-matching Wikipedia article. Here is an example call:

```
from tkinter import *
import wikipedia as wiki

# Clear
def clear():
    my_entry.delete(0, END)
    my_text.delete(0.0, END)


# Search
def search():
    data = wiki.page(my_entry.get())
    # Clear screen
    clear()
    # Output Wikipedia Results to Textbox
    my_text.insert(0.0, data.content)
```


### How to RECEIVE Data
On the same file, there is a function that will gather all of the headings and details of the article from the Wikipedia URL that the user requested. All the user must do is type their keywords in the search engine and the appropriate data should appear on the screen. Said data will also go into a .txt file that the user gets to name of their choice.
